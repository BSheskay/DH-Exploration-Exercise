## Anatoly Chernyaev: An brief introduction.

For the fourth unit of this class, I have chosen the journals of Anatoly Chernyaev as my data set. So, who is Anatoly Chernyaev? To give a very breif introduction: He was a historian who worked in the Soviet Union as an analyst for Brezhnev during the Soviet-Afgan war and later as a foreign policy advisor for Gorbachev until the fall of the Soviet Union. 

His personal diary features a fascinating first-person account of interactions at the highest level of the late Soviet Union. Chernyaev himself was generous enough to donate his writing to the National Security Archive based out of George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Many important and interesting parts of the diary has since been translated into English, however it is an ongoing effort.

## For my sanity, and yours.

Given the rather lackluster archival techniques used by the National Security Archives, I will place a link to a directory containing not only [PDFs, including a compiled PDF of all of the translated eneteries so far (as of June 2021) but also direct links to all of the info pages to the enteries](https://github.com/BSheskay/DH-Exploration-Exercise/tree/archive). Something that is bafflingly spread across several domains. Hopefully I will help some future student who experienced the same issues as I did.

## Anatoly Chernyaev: An brief introduction.

For the fourth unit of this class, I have chosen the journals of Anatoly Chernyaev as my data set. So, who is Anatoly Chernyaev? To give a very breif introduction: He was a historian who worked in the Soviet Union as an analyst for Brezhnev during the Soviet-Afgan war and later as a foreign policy advisor for Gorbachev until the fall of the Soviet Union. 

His personal diary features a fascinating first-person account of interactions at the highest level of the late Soviet Union. Chernyaev himself was generous enough to donate his writing to the National Security Archive based out of George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Many important and interesting parts of the diary has since been translated into English, however it is an ongoing effort.

## For my sanity, and yours.

Given the rather lackluster archival techniques used by the National Security Archives, I will place a link to a directory containing not only [PDFs, including a compiled PDF of all of the translated eneteries so far (as of June 2021) but also direct links to all of the info pages to the enteries](https://github.com/BSheskay/DH-Exploration-Exercise/tree/archive). Something that is bafflingly spread across several domains. Hopefully I will help some future student who experienced the same issues as I did.

## Chernyaev Demystified - Episode 0
My attempt a mini podcast. At this episode, I give a short introdution to Chernyaev, and proceed to ask why information about him is not as accessible as it should be. [Click here](/podcast.mp3) to listen to the audio.

## ~~The pain begins~~ Lets get started.
Building on to what I talked about on the podcast, working with data in the context of the Chernyaev Diaries proved to be an almost sisyphean task. Time and time again, I was stonewalled by the hydric monster of bad site design. For every issue I had and sorted, more issues appreared. 

I started this project with a simple task: Get all the data I need as quickly as possible. My naïveté was my downfall. So many issues I encountered, talking aspects from many different tutorials, from wget to API functionality. There was no misunderstanding or issue with the coding. This all came down to the horrfically poor design of the the site that the NS Archive had. Perhaps I am being too harsh, and I have nothing against the NS Archive. In fact I support their fight for freedom of information. That being said: When the NS Archive, a non-profit all about free access to information has exclusive access to documents, its rather ironic that they make the access to their docuemnts so poor. 

When I realized that all their documents were unorganized, that the PDF copies were housed across multiple domains, and their easily accessible pages, that have a monopoly on Google search results were *missing* essential enteries that could only be accessed by a manual search, I realized I needed to do something. That is why, I am making this site (even though it is not even realated to the work I am *supposed* to be doing for this project). 

## Here it is.

So with all that said, I have compiled all the relavent information pages as well as direct PDF links to the diary enteries, at least all of those that have been translated as of June 2021. Furthermore, [click here](https://github.com/BSheskay/DH-Exploration-Exercise/tree/archive/PDFs) to view the indiviual PDFs that I have archived in case one of the NS Archive hosting domains goes down. In that directory, there is also a PDF of [all compiled enteries to data](https://github.com/BSheskay/DH-Exploration-Exercise/blob/archive/PDFs/Anatoly%20Chernyaev%201972%20-%201980%2C%201985%20-%201991.pdf)
